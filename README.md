# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About Me.

I am a mathematician ecologist studying at James Cook University since 2019.
This repository includes basic and advanced code developments from basic
variable definitions, function and class construction, to GUI development.

### Clean code has...

1. well named variables, constants, functions, classes, programs, etc.
2. clearly worded doc-strings and comments.
3. appropriate indenting and spacing.

Following these three points may improve code readability for users.
