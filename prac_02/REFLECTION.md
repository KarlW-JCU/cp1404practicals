100%

Sunday/Monday ALL day

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watch all lectures, read practical instruction carefully, attempt practical extensions

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Resist over-thinking and over-developing practical activities

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Working too quickly;
I need to slow down and think about what is being taught and what is being asked in a task
to better absorb the learning and produce cleaner code with less mistakes.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Doing the content in order; that is, watching the lectures before seminars, then attempting 
practical activities before the practical timeslot, so I can request support if needed.
