# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I often overestimated the time needed to complete practical tasks.
Many tasks had simple solutions to implement and produce sample output.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I began to underestimate practical tasks as they gain complexity.
These more complex tasks often required more error testing and corrections which take time.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Predicting the difficulty or time required to complete tasks may be difficult,
and it may be best practice to allow more time than truly required when setting deadlines.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I am generally quite particular when self proofreading, leaving little for improvement;
or, peer reviewers do not put much effort into the task, offering little to improve.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Acknowledging the potential for learning difficulties and language barriers,
some people appear to lack any effort when attempting practical tasks.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 6 Feedback](https://github.com/tycabassi/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

I offer a lot of positive feedback to tasks which appear correct and functional, and hint towards reviewing subject 
documentation and lectures for support in potentially missed learning from the subject.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 7 Feedback](https://github.com/AshtonStewart/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

I attempt to offer positive motivation to continue incomplete tasks and scaffolding to attempted tasks 
without directly correcting errors or presenting answers. I believe this style of feedback motivates 
students to reflect on their own work and think deeper into their answers which improves retention.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Practical tasks seem well-paced for building content knowledge each week;
however, some of the sample code was too detailed, leaving little to modify for the task.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I read over the instructions multiple times and paced myself through the task;
however, there were still times when I missed detail or misinterpreted a task.
